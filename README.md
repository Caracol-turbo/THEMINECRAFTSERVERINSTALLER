Minecraft Server Installer

A simple and lightweight Bash-based installer for creating Minecraft servers from your terminal.

Instead of manually downloading server files, accepting the EULA, creating startup scripts, and configuring folders, this tool automates the entire process with an easy interactive menu.

«⚠️ Note: The installer is currently available only in Spanish. An English translation is planned for a future release.»

🖥️ How It Works

The installer will guide you through a few simple steps:

1. Select the server software.
2. Choose a supported Minecraft version.
3. Enter a server name.
4. Select the amount of RAM.
5. Wait while the installer downloads and prepares everything automatically.

Once finished, your server directory will contain everything required to start the server immediately.

For Forge and NeoForge, the installer also performs the server installation process automatically.

📁 Generated Structure

A typical server directory looks like this:

MyServer/
├── eula.txt
├── logs/
├── start.sh
├── server.jar
└── ...

Forge and NeoForge installations will generate their own files according to their official installers.
